TakahÄ“ is a new ActivityPub server, designed for efficient use on *small- to*
*medium-size* installations, and which allows you to host *multiple domains* on
the same infrastructure.

It's currently in an alpha state, meaning things work (and it will talk
ActivityPub to Mastodon and other servers), but there's still a lot of
[features left to add](https://takahe-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/).

The flagship instance can be found at [takahe.social](http://takahe.social),
and if you're interested, you can also [read more about the project](/about/),
or read some of [Andrew's blogs on building it](https://aeracode.org/category/takahe).
