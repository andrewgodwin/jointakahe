title: Takahē 0.9 Timeline Removal
---

In an upcoming release of Takahē, we are removing the timeline, compose, and
explore views from the Web UI; instead, we will be focusing on the app API
and ensuring compatibility with a large range of Mastodon client applications.

If you do not use the web UI currently, there is *nothing to do*; everything
will continue to work, and you'll just see a new UI if you log in to change
your settings.

If you do use the Takahē web UI as your primary interface, you will need to
migrate off of it to something else; we recommend [Elk](https://elk.zone) if
you want to keep using a web-based client, though there's quite a few options
for every platform.

At no point will any of your data or posts be affected.

This change will happen **on or after Friday 5th May**; we cannot give an exact
time, but we wanted to give anyone affected at least a week to switch.

If you want more background on this change, you can read about it in
[Andrew's latest blog post](https://aeracode.org/2023/04/29/refactor-treat/).

Thanks!
