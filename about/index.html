Pleroma, and others. Our goals are:</p><ul><li>Allowing multiple domains on the same server (&ldquo;virtual hosting&rdquo;)</li><li>Efficient, stable background tasks via asynchronous state machines</li><li>A default fast, low-JavaScript web interface</li><li>Mastodon Client API compatibility (eventually!)</li></ul><h2 id=why-start-another-server>Why start another server?</h2><p>The main motivation was to prove two things - that virtual hosting of multiple
domains on a single ActivityPub server was possible (so you don&rsquo;t need
to run a whole new server for every person or organisation that brings their
own domain), and to explore the use of Python&rsquo;s asynchronous libraries to
speed up the large amount of background work ActivityPub involves.</p><p>Fortunately, both of those have proved themselves to work well in the initial
build-out phase, and so now development is focused towards a small, reliable,
stable release.</p><p>While we do not expect to grow as large and featureful as Mastodon, the goal
is to provide a smaller, lighter-weight server that is useful for small- to
medium-size instances. The architecture we&rsquo;ve chosen is deliberately easy to
run and maintain but will not scale to a large install, and that&rsquo;s fine.</p><h2 id=more-insight>More Insight</h2><p>Takahē is, so far, mostly authored by <a href=https://aeracode.org/>Andrew Godwin</a>,
and you can read more about its development, choices made, and progress via
<a href=https://aeracode.org/category/takahe>my blog posts</a>.</p><h2 id=the-takahē>The Takahē</h2><p>The Takahē bird, after which this project is named, is a
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takah%C4%93>flightless bird from Aotearoa New Zealand</a> -
once thought extinct, but in recent decades they were rediscovered and have
been the subject of a successful breeding and reintroduction programme.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to donate to the ongoing efforts to establish a healthy
population and expansion into new areas, you can give money through the
<a href=https://nznaturefund.org/projects/takahe-recovery-programme/>New Zealand Nature Fund</a>.
The Takahē project maintains a regular monthly donation to the programme.</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Theme based on <a href=https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cayman-hugo-theme>Cayman</a></span></footer></section></body></html>
