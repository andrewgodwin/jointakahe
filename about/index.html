Pleroma, and others. Our goals are:</p><ul><li>Allowing multiple domains on the same server (&ldquo;virtual hosting&rdquo;)</li><li>Efficient, stable background tasks via asynchronous state machines</li><li>A default fast, low-JavaScript web interface</li><li>Mastodon Client API compatibility (eventually!)</li></ul><h2 id=why-start-another-server>Why start another server?</h2><p>The main motivation was to prove two things - that virtual hosting of multiple
domains on a single ActivityPub server was possible (so you don&rsquo;t need
to run a whole new server for every person or organisation that brings their
own domain), and to explore the use of Python&rsquo;s asynchronous libraries to
speed up the large amount of background work ActivityPub involves.</p><p>Fortunately, both of those have proved themselves to work well in the initial
build-out phase, and so now development is focused towards a small, reliable,
stable release.</p><p>While we do not expect to grow as large and featureful as Mastodon, the goal
is to provide a smaller, lighter-weight server that is useful for small- to
medium-size instances. The architecture we&rsquo;ve chosen is deliberately easy to
run and maintain but will not scale to a large install, and that&rsquo;s fine.</p><h2 id=more-insight>More Insight</h2><p>Takahē is, so far, mostly authored by <a href=https://aeracode.org/>Andrew Godwin</a>,
